# Agentic UI Builder

The current landscape of Beckn-enabled application development presents significant challenges, particularly in customizing user interfaces across diverse sectors like energy, retail, mobility, and more. Developers and businesses often face substantial overhead, requiring specialized knowledge and extensive manual effort to adapt user interfaces to specific domain requirements.

To address this issue, there is a clear need for a no-code, AI-powered developer tool capable of dynamically configuring the Beckn UI framework. This tool would empower non-technical users and developers alike to quickly create tailored, intuitive applications without traditional coding. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the tool should intelligently interpret domain-specific use cases and user requirements, automatically translating these into functional and visually appealing user interfaces.

Such a solution would drastically reduce development time, democratize access to Beckn Protocol ecosystems, and facilitate rapid innovation across various sectors, ultimately enabling a broader range of businesses to participate efficiently in the digital economy.
